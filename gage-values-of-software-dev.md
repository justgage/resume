# Gages work rules

## 1. Write boringly simple software
Remember that the road to hell is paved with premature optimizations. In the end you're going to guess wrong about what you need in the future (take this numbering for instance) so have the minimal code you need. 

When it's simple there's less code to understand, refractor, reuse, test and break.

Remember software is meant first for humans to understand then computers.

- Avoid abstractions till you know it's clearer than duplication
- Minimize external dependencies
- Hide implementation details
- Have as few moving parts as possible
- Avoid introducing esoteric features and concepts
- Avoid DSLs mostly
- Septate the business logic from side effects

## 2. Aim to never touch your code again
- Cover all the cases explicitly
- Use linters and static typing
- Just write the tests
- Do manual tests
- See #1

## 3. Be Humble
- Own up to mistakes
- Think about the better good of the team more than your personal preferences
- Understand others before you answer them
- Be objective about your code and ideas
- Strong opinions, loosely held
- Seek opinions 
- Avoid all snobbery

## 4. Address pain directly
Your costumers will love you for it.

- Find the root of the problem before you start coding


## 5. Explore new ideas
You can't apply a good idea if you don't know it exists. 

- Learn some math
- Learn from people who have strong opinions

## 7. Standardize arbitrary decisions
What a horrible waste of everyone's mental energy, just use `go fmt` like tools.

## 8. Lift others knowledge and skills tactfully
Help others learn powerful new ideas when they are open to learning it

## 9.  Fix the broken window, even if you didn't do it
Code can sometimes get hard to maintain, if you leave it that way it will only get worse. Clean code breeds clean code.

## 10. Fail fast to succeed sooner

- Use REPLs 
- Use TDD when appropriate
- make rapid prototype
- do it in postman first


## 11. Communicate

- Be Transparent about what you're doing. Give stake holders updates regularly
- Voice concerns early


## 12. Have fun

All work and no fun make Gage a dull person to work with
